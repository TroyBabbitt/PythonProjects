# PythonProjects
This is my Sal's shipping project from code academy.
This python program analyzes shipping costs for shipping from a variable cost ground shipping, fixed rate ground shipping, and drone shipping.
It calculates the cost of each shipping method based on the weight of the user's item.
I expanded on the project in two ways:
A. I added a user input that prompts the user to input the weight of their package.
B. I created a library to compare all three shipping costs and tell them which shipping method is the cheapest, while still allowing them to view the cost of all three shipping methods to create an informed decision.
